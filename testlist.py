#   flatten an array
#   Return factorial of given input (live coding session)
#   Return sorted odd numbers of a given array of integers (live coding session)
#   Flood fill algorithm image processing example
#   Anagrams  You're given a list of strings, e.g. ['dog', 'fog', 'god', 'cat', 'big', 'tac']. Find all anagram pairs.
#   Calculate distance between two points
# Computational Complexity (O(n))
# streams manipulation,  (learn about for each / map/ lambda/ reg express)
# dichotomy search, etc
#   Count the number of integers repeated in an array
#   Given a stream with HasNext and GetNext, containing points (x,y), write a function that returns N points closest to origin
